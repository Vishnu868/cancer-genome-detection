# Cancer Detection in Genome using String Matching

This project uses advanced **string-matching algorithms** to detect cancer-causing DNA mutations by analyzing patient genomic data. It leverages the speed and efficiency of **Aho-Corasick** (for multi-pattern search) and **Boyer-Moore** (for sequence comparison) algorithms.

The goal is to aid in **early cancer detection**, mutation classification, and visualization for **genomics research** and **diagnostic support**, especially in **resource-limited environments**.

## Features

- Fast mutation detection with **Aho-Corasick** algorithm
- Efficient sequence comparison using **Boyer-Moore**
- Classification of mutations (e.g., substitution, deletion)
- Visualizations of:
  - Mutation type distribution
  - Cancer type frequency
  - Region-wise mutation heatmaps (optional)
- Reference Genome vs. Mutated Genome comparison
- Useful for bioinformatics, medical diagnostics, and cancer research
